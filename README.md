## Project Overview
The Airport Management System (AMS) is developed as part of the CS320 Software Engineering course. This project aims to provide a comprehensive simulation of an airport's core operations, including flight scheduling, passenger booking, and airplane management. It integrates multiple features to showcase real-world software engineering practices.

## Features
- **Flight Management** 
Add, update, and delete flight schedules.
Search for flights by destination, date, or flight number.
Maintain detailed records of flight statuses.

-**Passenger Management**
Register passengers and manage bookings.
View and modify passenger details.
Search for bookings using passenger IDs or flight numbers.

-**Plane Management**
Track airplane details, including models, capacities, and statuses.
Log maintenance history and schedule future checkups.
Monitor active and inactive planes. 

- **System Highlights**
User-Friendly Interface: Simple navigation for administrators and staff.
Error Handling: Graceful error notifications and validations.
